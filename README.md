## Getting Started

### Running the app locally
I suggest you to create a separate virtual environment running Python 3 for this app, and install all of the required dependencies there. Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

```
https://github.com/mainadwitiya/CoVid-19-Tracker-Coronavirus-.git
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```
In UNIX system: 

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
In Windows: 

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install all of the required packages to this environment, simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and all of the required `pip` packages, will be installed, and the app will be able to run.
